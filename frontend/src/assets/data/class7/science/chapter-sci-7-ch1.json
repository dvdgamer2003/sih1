Such changes are called adaptations. They take place over a long period of time.\n\n## Adaptation in Aquatic Plants\n\nSome of the aquatic plants are firmly rooted in the soil at the bottom of the water bodies. Their stems are submerged, while leaves and flowers float on the surface. However, some plants are entirely afloat. Their roots are not anchored in the soil.\n\nThe surfaces of leaves and stems of many aquatic plants are covered with a waxy layer. Leaves of some aquatic plants are thin and slender like a ribbon. This shape helps them to withstand fast currents of water. Air spaces in stems and petioles of aquatic plants are useful for floating in water."

            "content": "# Adaptation in Desert Plants\n\nTake two potted plants - one a cactus and the other a leafy plant. Tie plastic bags loosely around the leaves of these plants and keep them in sunlight from early in the morning. In the afternoon, bring those pots into the classroom and observe them.\n\nHas the same quantity of water collected in both bags? Neither do desert plants have leaves or they are very small or they are modified into thorns. As a result, they lose very little water by evaporation. The stem stores water and food and is therefore fleshy. The stems are green as they perform photosynthesis in the absence of leaves. Their roots penetrate deep into the soil in search of water. There is a thick layer of a waxy substance on the stems of these plants, too."

            "content": "# Classification of Living Organisms\n\nIt is difficult to study and remember all the organisms in this diverse living world at the same time. Classification helps in this respect. Different scientists have used different criteria and independently classified plants and animals. A hierarchy is formed in the classification that starts with Kingdom Animalia or Kingdom Plantae; further groups and sub-groups are formed depending upon basic similarities and differences. This is called the 'hierarchy of classification'.\n\n## Binomial Nomenclature by Carl Linnaeus\n\nImagine that there are four students with a name 'Kabir' or 'Kiran' in a classroom. If you talk about 'Kabir' or 'Kiran' in class, how will you ensure that others understand which one of them you are talking about? We shall mention their full names, i.e., the first name and the last name. This is similar to binomial nomenclature.\n\nBinomial nomenclature is used to identify each organism. Accordingly, a scientific name has been assigned to each organism. It consists of two parts - the first part is 'Genus' and the second, 'Species'. All identified organisms have been assigned a binomial name as per the guidelines of the International Code of Nomenclature."
