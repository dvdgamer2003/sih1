This is called place value.\n\n## Understanding Place Value\n\n- **Ones**: The rightmost digit\n- **Tens**: The second digit from right\n- **Hundreds**: The third digit from right\n- **Thousands**: The fourth digit from right\n\n### Example\nIn the number 3,456:\n- 6 is in the ones place (value = 6)\n- 5 is in the tens place (value = 50)\n- 4 is in the hundreds place (value = 400)\n- 3 is in the thousands place (value = 3000)\n\nTotal value = 3000 + 400 + 50 + 6 = 3,456"

If digits are same, compare from left to right\n3. Use symbols: > (greater than), < (less than), = (equal to)\n\n### Examples\n- 456 > 234 (4 hundreds > 2 hundreds)\n- 789 < 987 (7 hundreds < 9 hundreds)\n- 555 = 555 (equal)"
