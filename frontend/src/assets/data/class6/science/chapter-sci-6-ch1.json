            "content": "# Air\n\nThe air in the atmosphere around the earth contains nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, six inert gases, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, water vapour and dust particles. The troposphere contains about 80% of the total mass of gases in the air, while this proportion is about 19% in the stratosphere.\n\n## Composition of Air\n\n- **Nitrogen (78%)**: Helps living things to build the necessary proteins. It is useful in the production of ammonia and in airtight packaging of foodstuffs.\n- **Oxygen (21%)**: Necessary for respiration in living things and for combustion.\n- **Argon (0.9%)**: Used in electric bulbs.\n- **Carbon dioxide (0.03%)**: Plants use it for producing their food. Used in fire extinguishers.\n- **Other constituents**: Helium, Neon, Krypton, Xenon.\n\n![Composition of Air](https://example.com/air_composition.png)\n\n## Air Pollution\n\nSmoke directly mixes with the atmosphere, disturbing the balance between the constituents of air. This is called air pollution. Harmful gases are given out through combustion of fuels in vehicles and in big industries and also through incomplete combustion of fuels like wood and coal."

It is found in oceans, seas, rivers, lakes, ponds, and underground.\n\n## Properties of Water\n\n- Water is a universal solvent.\n- It has no color, taste, or odor.\n- It exists in three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapour).\n\n## Water Cycle\n\nThe continuous movement of water from the earth's surface to the atmosphere and back to the earth is called the water cycle."

All terrestrial animals including man live on land.\n\n## Soil Formation\n\nThe soil on the land is formed by a natural process. The abiotic components of soil are supplied through the weathering of the bedrock. Due to the heat, cold and water of the sun, wind and rain respectively, the bedrock breaks down into pieces. Stones, sand and soil are formed from these pieces."
